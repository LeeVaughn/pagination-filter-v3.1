### Questions
* Do we need to mention global variables for this project? They aren't really necessary as all of the needed variables can just be created in the functions where they are used. (see line 64 in `\instructions\INSTRUCTIONS.md` and line 15 in `/js/script.js`)
* Do we need to recommend that students create a "data" variable in `script.js` since they can just access the `data` variable from `data.js` directly? (see line 12 in `/js/script.js`)
* How should things like Pro Tips and Notes be formatted in the instructions? Different projects use different formatting so not sure which is the current best practice. (see lines 15 and 52 of `\instructions\INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the two versions)
* Should we provide the student an example of the template literal needed to create the student data elements? (see line 79 of `/js/script.js`)
* Should we rename the `appendPageLinks` function since we no longer append or create links with a tags? (see line 103 of `/js/script.js`)
* Do we need to cite sources at the top of the `data.js` file? (see line 5 of `/js/data.js`)
